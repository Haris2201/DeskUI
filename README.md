# DeskUI
Web desktop for servers

## Project
DeskUI is a web desktop for servers coming with a set of pre-installed apps (e.g. terminal, file browser and more) and also giving you a fully functional JavaScript framework allowing you to create your own apps with **just one line of code**.
Additionally the framework provides you a complete window management, a widget collection with notifications and dialog boxes, core functionalities like including additional scripts and a menu generator; there will also be more stuff added soon.

DeskUI comes in really handy when you need to work on your server (like uploading files or restarting system services) from someone else's computer without installing new applications.
Therefore DeskUI renders third-party applications (e.g. SSH/telnet clients, FTP clients, etc.) unnecessary and also gives you the benefits of a normal desktop.

## Status
DeskUI is not nearly finished; **do not install DeskUI on your public servers** yet because it may have bugs that could be exploited!

However if you want to take a sneak peek or maybe develop apps for DeskUI just download the source and load it onto a local web server (e.g. Apache using xampp); also make sure that you're the only one who is able to connect to your local web server.

## Contribution
